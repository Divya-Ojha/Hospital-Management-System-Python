This is a simple python project simulating the working of a Hospital Management System.

ðŸ‘‰ First run this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Then run the tables_hospital.py file to create tables and fill it in the database. (Remember to change the parameters so that it can connect to MySQL on your device)<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Now you're good to go, run the HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT.py file to launch the program.
